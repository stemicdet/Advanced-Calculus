          Suppose that <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[1,5]</m> and differentiable on <m>(1,5)</m>. Also suppose that <m>-2 &lt; f'(x) &lt; 10</m> for all <m>x \in (1,5)</m>. If <m>f(1) = 4</m>, what are the largest and smallest possible values for <m>f(5)</m>?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
<p>
  Let <m>n \in \mathbf{N}</m> and suppose that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = \lim_{x\to 0} f'(x) = \lim_{x\to 0} f''(x) = \ldots = \lim_{x\to 0} f^{(n-1)}(x)=0</m> but <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0} f^{(n)}(x)=1</m>. Show that
  <md>
    \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{xf'(x)}{f(x)} = n .

     Let <m>f</m> be differentiable on an interval <m>A</m>.

    <p>
      If <m>f'(x) \neq 0</m> on <m>A</m> show that <m>f</m> is one-to-one on <m>A</m>.

      Provide an example to show that the converse statement need not be true.

Suppose that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> and differentiable on <m>(a,b)</m>. Also suppose that <m>f(a) = g(a)</m> and <m>f'(x) &lt; g'(x)</m> for all <m>x \in (a,b)</m>. Show that <m>f(b) &lt; g(b)</m>.
  </p>

<li>
  <p>
  A <em>fixed point</em> of a function <m>f</m> is a value <m>x</m> where <m>f(x) = x</m>. Show that if <m>f</m> is differentiable on an interval with <m>f'(x)\neq 1</m>, then <m>f</m> can have at most one fixed point.
