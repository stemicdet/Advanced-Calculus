          Give an example to show that the product <m>(f_n g_n)</m> may not converge uniformly.

Suppose that <m>f_n \to f</m> uniformly on a set <m>A</m>. Show that if each <m>f_n</m> is bounded, then <m>f</m> is also bounded.

  <p>
  Suppose that <m>f_n \to f</m> uniformly on a set <m>A</m>. Show that if each <m>f_n</m> is uniformly continuous, then <m>f</m> is also uniformly continuous.
