          Let <md>g_n(x) = \frac{nx+x^2}{2n}</md>
          and set <m>g(x) = \lim g_n(x)</m>. Show that <m>g</m> is differentiable in two ways:
        </p>
        <ol marker="(A)">
          <li>
            <p>
              Compute <m>g(x)</m> by algebraically taking the limit as <m>n\to \infty</m> and then find <m>g'(x)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Compute <m>g_n'(x)</m> for each <m>n \in \mathbf{N}</m> and show the sequence of derivatives <m>(g_n')</m> converges uniformly on every interval <m>[-M,M]</m>. Use the Differentiable Limit Theorem to conclude <m>g'(x) = \lim g_n'(x)</m>.

        <p>
          Consider the sequence of functions
          <md>
            h_n(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{n}}
          </md>

        <ol marker="(A)">
          <li>
            <p>
              Compute the pointwise limit of <m>(h_n)</m> and then prove that the convergence is uniform on <m>\mathbf{R}</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Note that each <m>h_n</m> is differentiable. Show <m>g(x) = \lim h_n'(x)</m> exists for all <m>x</m>, and explain how we can be certain that the convergence is \textbf{not} uniform on any neighborhood of <m>0</m>.

       <p>
         We constructed a nowhere differentiable function in the following way: define <m>h(x) = |x|</m> on the interval <m>[-1,1]</m> and extend <m>h(x)</m> to all <m>\mathbf{R}</m> by requiring that <m>h(x+2) = h(x)</m> and define
        <md>
          g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} h(2^n x)
        </md>
        In class we showed that <m>g(x)</m> is not differentiable at any point. Show that <m>g(x)</m> is continuous on <m>\mathbf{R}</m>.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prove that 
          <md>
            h(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n^2} = x+\frac{x^2}{4}+ \frac{x^3}{9} + \ldots
          </md>
          is continuous on <m>[-1,1]</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prove that
          <md>
             f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n^3}= x+\frac{x^2}{8}+ \frac{x^3}{27} + \ldots
          </md>
          is differentiable on <m>[-1,1]</m> and its derivative is given by
          <md>
             f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{n-1}}{n^2} = 1+\frac{x}{4}+ \frac{x^2}{9} + \ldots
          </md>
