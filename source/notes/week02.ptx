    <title>The Mean Value Theorem</title>

    <p>
      Imagine that you are going to sail to Ireland. You could choose to sail in a straight line path or you could choose a curvier route, but no matter what route you choose, at some point you have to head in the same direction as the straight line path.

    <p>
      This observation is expressed mathematically by a result known as the Mean Value Theorem, which states that for a differentiable function the slope of the secant line between <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m> is equal to the slope of the tangent line at some point between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
