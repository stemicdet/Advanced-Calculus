  <title> Non-differentiability</title>

<p>
    We saw that the absolute value function fails to be differentiable at <m>0</m> because of the sharp corner at <m>0</m>.
</p>

<p>
    Given a finite set of points, it is possible to construct a continuous function with a sharp corner at each point and thus we have a continuous function that fails to be differentiable at a finite set of points.
</p>

<p>
    It is possible to construct a continuous function that is nondifferentiable at infinitely many points. Let <m>h(x) = |x|</m> on the interval <m>[-1,1]</m> and then extend <m>h(x)</m> to all <m>\mathbf{R}</m> through the relation <m>h(x+2) = h(x)</m>. This function is nondifferentiable at all the integers.

    Is it possible to construct a function that is continuous everywhere but that is non-differentiable at uncountably many points?
  </p> 
  
  <p>
    Around 1830 Bernard Bolzano constructed a function that is continuous everywhere but fails to be differentiable at every point in <m>\mathbf{R}</m>; however, he never published this result.
  </p>

  <p>
    About 1860 Charles Cellerier constructed another function that is everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable. He also never published his result.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first published example of a function that is everywhere continuous and nowhere differentiable is due to Karl Weierstrass in 1872.

            <em>[Up to that time] one would have said that a continuous function is essentially capable of being represented by a curve, and that a curve has always a tangent. Such reasoning has no mathematical value whatever; it is founded on intuition, or rather on a visible representation. ... By the discovery of this striking example Weierstrass has accordingly given us a useful reminder, and has taught us better to appreciate the faultless and purely arithmetical methods with which he more than any one has enriched our science.</em> -- Henri Poincare

      Although nowhere differentiable continuous functions were created to challenge previously held beliefs in mathematics, they do have important physical applications.

      In 1905 Albert Einstein published a paper which demonstrated the existence of atoms. In this paper Einstein showed that atoms exhibit <em>Brownian Motion</em> which means that they follow a random path because they are constantly bombarded by other particles which changes their direction of motion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of this randomness, the path of an object that exhibits Brownian motion can't be modeled by a smooth curve. One must use a continuous non-differentiable function to model Brownian motion.
    </p>

      Weierstrass' original function was the function <md>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \cos(b^n x)
      </md>

      where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are carefully chosen real numbers.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      The Weierstrass function is an example of a Fourier series, which is an infinite sum of sines and cosines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remarkably the Weierstrass function is nowhere differentiable despite the fact that the functions in the sum are infinitely differentiable everywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will give another example of an everywhere continuous nowhere differentiable function. Recall that <m>h(x) = |x|</m> on <m>[-1,1]</m> and is extended to all <m>\mathbf{R}</m> by the functional equation <m>h(x+2) = h(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>h_n(x) = \frac{1}{2^n}h(2^nx)</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Let
      <md>
        g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} h_n(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^n}h(2^nx)
      </md>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      We will show that <m>g(x)</m> is continuous on all <m>\mathbf{R}</m> but differentiable nowhere.

        <description>A picture of the graphs of three functions. The first in orange is the graph of <m>h_0</m>. It looks like a triangle starting at <m>(0,0)</m>, which rises up to <m>(1,1)</m> before falling down to <m>(2,0)</m>. Then it repeats indefinitely. The second graph in green is the graph of <m>h_1</m>. It looks like a triangle starting at <m>(0,0)</m> that rises up to <m>(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})</m> before falling down to <m>(1,0)</m>. Then it repeats this pattern indefinitely. The final graph in blue is the graph of <m>h_2</m>. It is a triangle that starts at <m>(0,0)</m> and rises to <m>(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4})</m> before falling to <m>(\frac{1}{2},0)</m>. The it repeats indefinitely </description>
