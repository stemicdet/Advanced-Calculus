  <title> Non-differentiability</title>

<p>
    We saw that the absolute value function fails to be differentiable at $0$ because of the sharp corner at $0$.
</p>

<p>
    Given a finite set of points, it is possible to construct a continuous function with a sharp corner at each point and thus we have a continuous function that fails to be differentiable at a finite set of points.
</p>

<p>
    It is possible to construct a continuous function that is nondifferentiable at infinitely many points. Let $h(x) = |x|$ on the interval $[-1,1]$ and then extend $h(x)$ to all $\mathbf{R}$ through the relation $h(x+2) = h(x)$. This function is nondifferentiable at all the integers.
