    <title>Function Approximation</title>

    <p>
        Given a relatively complicated function we might wish to approximate it by simpler functions such as polynomials, rational functions, trigonometric functions or exponential functions. This way we could simplify calculations involving the more complicated function. 
    </p>

    <p>
        There are several noteworthy results which show how a large number of functions can be approximated by relatively simple functions.
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Taylor series: Given a function <m>f</m> that is infinitely differentiable at a point <m>x_0</m> there is a sequence of polynomials that approximates <m>f</m> near <m>x_0</m>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Fourier series: Similar to a Taylor series but with sines and cosines (or complex exponentials) used as approximants instead of polynomials.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Runge's Theorem (1885): If <m>K</m> is a compact subset of the complex plane then every function that is analytic (i.e. complex differentiable) in a neighborhood of <m>K</m> can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of rational functions.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Weierstrass Approximation Theorem (1885): Every continuous function on <m>\mathbf{R}</m> can be uniformly approximated by polynomials.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Mergelyan's Theorem (1951): Let <m>K</m> be a compact subset of the complex plane such that <m>K^c</m> is connected. Then every function analytic on a neighborhood of <m>K</m> can be uniformly approximated by polynomials.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        A function <m>f</m> can be approximated by polynomials (rational functions) if there is a sequence <m>(f_n)</m> of polynomials (rational functions) that converges to <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given one of these approximations, we might ask which properties of the approximating functions extend to the limit functions. For example
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If <m>f(x)</m> is the limit of a Fourier series, is <m>f(x)</m> a continuous function?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If <m>g(x)</m> is the limit of a sequence of polynomials, is <m>g(x)</m> necessarily a differentiable?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In this chapter, we will investigate these and other questions concerning approximation.
                </p>

        </ol>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-Pointwise-Convergence">
        <title>Pointwise Convergence</title>

        <p>
            The first thing we need to do to build up a theory of function approximation is to define what it means for a sequence of functions to converge. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As it turns out, there are multiple different ways that we can define what it means for a sequence of functions to converge. We will start by extending the notion of converge of a sequence from last semester.
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-pointwise">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    For each <m>n \in \mathbf{N}</m> let <m>f_n</m> be a function defined on a set <m>A \subseteq \mathbf{R}</m>. The sequence <m>(f_n)</m> <em> converges pointwise on <m>A</m></em> to a function <m>f</m> if for all <m>x \in A</m>, the sequence of real numbers <m>f_n(x)</m> converges to <m>f(x)</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>
            In this case we write <m>f_n \to f</m>, <m>\lim f_n = f</m>, or <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to \infty} f_n(x) = f(x)</m>
        </p>

        <p>
            The questions that we've raised about whether the limit of a sequence of continuous (or differentiable) functions is itself continuous (or differentiable) is really a question about when we are allowed to interchange limits.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose <m>f_n \to f</m> and each <m>f_n</m> is continuous at <m>c</m>. For <m>f</m> to be continuous at <m>c</m>, we must show that 
            <md>
                \lim_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c).
            </md>
            
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that
            <md>
                \lim_{x\to c} f(x) = \lim_{x\to c} \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{x\to c} f_n(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(c) = f(c)
            </md>

            but only if the interchange of limits is justified.

            Let <m>f_n(x) = \frac{x}{n}</m>. For each <m>x</m>, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{x}{n} = 0</m>. Thus <m>f_n(x)</m> converges pointwise to <m>0</m>.

        <title>Uniform Convergence</title>
        
        <p>
            The second example shows that if a sequence of continuous functions converges pointwise to a limit function, the limit function is not necessarily a continuous function.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cauchy 1821: Theorem that if a sum of continuous functions converges then the limit function is continuous.
        </p>

        <p>
            Abel 1826: Cauchy's theorem admits exceptions such as <m>\sin \phi -\frac{1}{2} \sin 2\phi + \frac{1}{3} \sin 3\phi - \ldots</m> , which is discontinuous at every value of <m>(2m+1)\pi</m> , where <m>m</m>  is an integer.
        </p>

        <p>
            It has been argued; however, that Cauchy's theorem is not wrong and that Cauchy knew about Abel's exception but it is not a counterexample to his theorem.
        </p>

        <p>
            The issue involves what did Cauchy mean by a convergent sum. Abel interpreted Cauchy's theorem as pointwise convergence, which is false as his exception shows.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, Cauchy may have meant for convergence to mean a stronger type than pointwise convergence, which today is called uniform convergence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Abel's exception is not uniformly convergent and thus would not be a counterexample to Cauchy's theorem. In fact, Cauchy's theorem is correct if the convergence is uniform convergence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before introducing the definition of uniform convergence, let's restate the definition of pointwise convergence in terms of <m>\epsilon</m> .
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-pointwise-convergence-epsilon">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>(f_n)</m>  be a sequence of functions defined on a set <m>A \subseteq \mathbf{R}</m> . Then <m>(f_n)</m>  converges pointwise on <m>A</m>  to a limit <m>f</m>  defined on <m>A</m>  if, for every <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>  and <m>x \in A</m> , there exists <m>N(\epsilon,x) \in \mathbf{N}</m>  (perhaps dependent on <m>x</m> ) such that <m>|f_n(x)-f(x)| &lt; \epsilon</m>  whenever <m>n \geq N</m> .
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>
         Notice that the choice of <m>N</m>  may depend on the point <m>x</m> .
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-uniform-convergence">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>(f_n)</m>  be a sequence of functions on a set <m>A \subseteq \mathbf{R}</m> . Then <m>(f_n)</m>  converges uniformly  on <m>A</m>  to a limit function defined on <m>A</m>  if for every <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>  there exists <m>N(\epsilon) \in \mathbf{N}</m>  such that <m>|f_n(x)-f(x)|&lt; \epsilon</m>  whenever <m>n \geq N</m>  and <m>x \in A</m> .
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <p>
            The difference between uniform and convergence and pointwise convergence is that in uniform convergence for each <m>\epsilon>0</m>  a single <m>N</m>  must work for all <m>x \in A</m>  while in pointwise convergence for each <m>\epsilon &gt;0</m>  and <m>x \in A</m>  different choices of <m>N</m>  may be used.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let <m>f_n(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{n}</m> . Show that <m>f_n(x)</m>  converges uniformly to <m>0</m>  on <m>\mathbf{R}</m> .

            But this means that <m>n</m>  depends on the choice of <m>x</m>  (note that as <m>x\to 1^-</m> , <m>n \to \infty</m> ) and thus the convergence is not uniform.

        <p>
            In the two examples of sequences of continuous functions that converge to a limit function that is not continuous, the convergence has been pointwise convergence but not uniform convergence. In fact, if a sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function will also be continuous.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>(f_n)</m> be a sequence of functions defined on <m>A \subseteq \mathbf{R}</m> that converges uniformly on <m>A</m> to a function <m>f</m>. If each <m>f_n</m> is continuous at <m>c \in A</m>, then <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>c</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>

        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>c \in A</m> be fixed and let <m>\epsilon &gt;0</m>. It follows from the definition of uniform continuity that there exists <m>N(\epsilon)\in \mathbf{N}</m> such that <m>|f_n(x)-f(x)| &lt; \epsilon</m> whenever <m>n \geq N</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because <m>f_N</m> is continuous at <m>c</m>, there exists <m>\delta &gt; 0</m> such that <m>|f_N(x)-f_N(c)| &lt; \epsilon</m> whenever <m>|x-c| &lt;\delta</m>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to show that <m>|f(x)-f(c)|</m> can be made arbitrarily small by choosing <m>|x-c|</m> sufficiently small.
            </p>

            <p>
                Putting this all together we get that if <m>|x-c| &lt; \delta</m>
                <md>
                    <mrow> |f(x)-f(c)| \amp = |f(x)-f_N(x) + f_N(x) -f_N(c)+f_N(c)-f(c)|</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp \leq |f(x)-f_N(x)| + |f_N(x)-f_N(c)| + |f_N(c)-f(c)| </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp &lt; \epsilon + \epsilon + \epsilon = 3\epsilon</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>

            <p>
                Since <m>\epsilon</m> can be made arbitrarily small, so can <m>3\epsilon</m> and thus <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>c</m>.
            </p>
        </proof>

        <p>
            Something to consider: If convergence is only pointwise, where does the proof break down?

            There is a Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence similar to the one for sequences.
