    <title>Convergence of Derivatives</title>

    <p>
        Suppose <m>(f_n)</m> is a sequence of functions that converges (in some sense) to a limit function <m>f</m>. Under what conditions will the sequence of derivatives <m>(f_n'(x))</m> converge to <m>f'(x)</m>?
    </p>

    <p>
        This is an important problem in approximation theory If we are approximating a function by polynomials we want to be sure that the derivatives of the polynomials will be close to the derivative of the limit function.
    </p>

    <p>
        As an example, let <m>f_n(x) = \frac{\sin(nx)}{n}</m>. Verify that <m>f_n(x)</m> converges uniformly to <m>0</m>, but <m>\lim f_n'(x)</m> is undefined.

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-Differentiable-Limit">
        <title>Differentiable Limit Theorem</title>
        
<p>
    These examples show that in order for the sequence of derivatives to converge to the derivative of the limit function, it is not enough that the sequence of functions converges uniformly to the limit function. It is not even enough that the sequence of functions converges uniformly to the limit function and the sequence of derivatives converges pointwise.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-Differentiable-Limit">
    <title>Differentiable Limit Theorem</title>
    
    
    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>f_n \to f</m> pointwise on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> and assume that each <m>f_n</m> is differentiable. If <m>(f_n')</m> converges uniformly on <m>[a,b]</m> to a function <m>g</m>, then the function <m>f</m> is differentiable and <m>f'=g</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
    <p>
        Choose <m>c \in [a,b]</m> and let <m>\epsilon &gt;0</m>. We want to show that <m>f'(c)</m> exists and equals <m>g(c)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This means we must find <m>\delta &gt; 0</m> such that whenever <m>|x-c| &lt; \delta</m>, 
        <md>
            \left| \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c} - g(c) \right| &lt; \epsilon
        </md>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        The triangle inequality implies that 
        <md>
             \left| \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c} - g(c) \right| \leq \left|\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c} - \frac{f_n(x)-f_n(c)}{x-c} \right| + \left|\frac{f_n(x)-f_n(c)}{x-c} - f_n'(c) \right| + |f_n'(c)-g(c)|
        </md>
    </p>

    <p>
        The first term on the right can be made arbitrarily small because <m>f_n</m> converges to <m>f</m>. The second term can be made arbitrarily small because <m>f_n'(c)</m> is the derivative of <m>f_n</m> at <m>c</m>. The last term can be made arbitrarily small because <m>f_n'(c)</m> converges uniformly to <m>g</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        We'll start with bounding the last term. By uniform convergence, there exists <m>N_1</m> such that 
        <md xml:id="eq1" number="yes">
            |f_m'(c)-g(c)| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3}
        </md>
        for all <m>m \geq N_1 </m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition using the Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence we have that there exists <m>N_2</m> such that when <m>m,n\geq N_2</m>,
        <md>
            |f_m'(x) -f_n'(x)| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3}
        </md>
        for all <m>x \in [a,b]</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let <m>N = N_1+N_2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now let's bound the middle term. The function <m>f_N</m> is differentiable at <m>c</m> and hence there exists <m>\delta &gt; 0</m> such that whenever <m>0 &lt;|x-c| &lt; \delta</m>,
        <md xml:id="eq2" number="yes">
            \left|\frac{f_N(x)-f_N(c)}{x-c} - f_N'(c) \right| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3}.
        </md>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Now fix <m>x</m> satisfying <m>0 &lt;|x-c| &lt; \delta</m>. It just remains to bound the first term which we will do with the help of the Mean Value Theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Applying the MVT to the function <m>f_m-f_N</m> on the interval <m>[c,x]</m> (or <m>[x,c]</m>) yields that there exists <m>\alpha</m> in the interval such that
        <md>
            f_m'(\alpha)-f_N'(\alpha) = \frac{(f_m(x)-f_N(x))-(f_m(c)-f_N(c))}{x-c}
        </md>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Since <m>m,N > N_2</m>, <m>|f_m'(\alpha)-f_N'(\alpha)|&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3}</m>. Hence
        <md>
            \left|\frac{(f_m(x)-f_N(x))-(f_m(c)-f_N(c))}{x-c}\right| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3}
        </md>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore
        <md>
            \left|\frac{f_m(x)-f_m(c)}{x-c} - \frac{f_N(x)-f_N(c)}{x-c}\right| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3}
        </md>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Since <m>f_m</m> converges to <m>f</m> taking the limit as <m>m \to \infty</m> yields
        <md xml:id="eq3" number="yes">
            \left|\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c} - \frac{f_N(x)-f_N(c)}{x-c}\right| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3}
        </md>
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally combining <xref ref="eq1"/>, <xref ref="eq2"/> and <xref ref="eq3"/> gives that for <m>0 &lt; |x-c|&lt; \delta</m>
        <md>
            \left|\frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}- g(c)\right| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{3} + \frac{\epsilon}{3}+ \frac{\epsilon}{3} = \epsilon.
        </md>
        
    </p>
</proof>

<p>
    In the statement of the Differentiable Limit Theorem, it is not necessary to have that <m>(f_n)</m> converges pointwise to <m>g</m> on all <m>[a,b]</m>; it is just enough for it to converge at a single point.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm-differentiable-limit-2">
    <statement>
        <p>
             Let <m>(f_n)</m> be a sequence of differentiable functions defined on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> and suppose <m>(f_n')</m> converges uniformly to a function <m>[a,b]</m>. If there exists a point <m>x_0 \in [a,b]</m> for which <m>f_n(x_0)</m> is convergent, then <m>(f_n)</m> converges uniformly. Moreover the limit function <m>f = \lim f_n</m> is differentiable and satisfies <m>f' = g</m>.
        </p>
    </statement>
</theorem>

   <subsection xml:id="subsec-Kerala-School">
    <title>The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics</title>
    
    <p>
      Kerala is a region of southwest India. During the 14th century A.D. a group of astronomers and mathematicians led by Madhava of Sangamagrama founded a school which today is known as the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics.
    </p>

    <p>
      While they were focused on solving astronomical problems, they discovered a number of important mathematical results including formulas for calculating sines and cosines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The remarkable feature of these formulas is that they involve infinite sums.
    </p>

    <p>  Madhava (died 1425 A.D.) gave the following instructions for calculating the sine function.
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Multiply the arc by the square of the arc, and take the result of repeating that (any number of times). Divide (each of the above numerators) by the squares of the successive even numbers increased by that number and multiplied by the square of the radius. Place the arc and the successive results so obtained one below the other, and subtract each from the one above. These together give the jiva, as collected together in the verse beginning with "vidvan" etc."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      In Indian mathematics at the time the jiva referred to the function $r \sin \theta$ where $r$ is a fixed radius of a circle.
    </p>

    <p>
      In modern mathematical notation, Madhava's formula is as follows.
      <md>
        \sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-1)^n\dfrac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!}+\ldots
      </md>
      where $n!$ is the product of $n$, $n-1$, \ldots 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another remarkable formula due to Madhava is a method for calculating the arctangent function. In the passage below sine and cosine refer to the Indian sine ($r \sin \theta$) and Indian cosine ($r\cos \theta)$
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "The first term is the product of the given sine and radius of the desired arc divided by the cosine of the arc. The succeeding terms are obtained by a process of iteration when the first term is repeatedly multiplied by the square of the sine and divided by the square of the cosine. All the terms are then divided by the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, .... The arc is obtained by adding and subtracting respectively the terms of odd rank and those of even rank. It is laid down that the sine of the arc or that of its complement whichever is the smaller should be taken here as the given sine. Otherwise the terms obtained by this above iteration will not tend to the vanishing magnitude"
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      In modern notation this would be written as
      <md>
        \arctan(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{2n+1} = x-\frac{x^3}{3}+ \frac{x^5}{5}-\frac{x^7}{7} + \ldots
      </md>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      By letting $x=1$ Madhava came up with a formula for calculating $\frac{\pi}{4}$
      <md>
        \frac{\pi}{4} = 1-\frac{1}{3}+ \frac{1}{5}- \frac{1}{7} + \ldots
      </md>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Madhava's formula's demonstrate that a series of simple functions can be a powerful tool for approximating more complicated functions. However, there are a number of issues that we need to address.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            In what sense do Madhava's series converge to the desired function?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In general, if a series of continuous functions converges, is the limit function also continuous?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In general, if a series of differentiable functions converges, is the limit function also differentiable?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Are we justified in substituting $x=1$ into Madhava's series for $\arctan(x)$ to get a formula for $\frac{\pi}{4}$?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      We start our investigation into series of functions by defining what it means for a series of functions to converge.

          converges pointwise on $A$ to $f(x)$ if the sequence $s_k(x)$ of partial sums defined by

          <md>

        </p>

        <p>
          The series converges uniformly on $A$ to $f(x)$ if the sequence $s_k(x)$ converges uniformly on $A$ to $f(x)$.

        <p>
          In either case we write

            f = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_n

          always being explicit about the type of convergence involved.
