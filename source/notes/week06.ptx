    <title>The Binomial Series</title>

    <p>
      The Binomial Theorem demonstrates the correct way to expand the powers of a binomial.
      <md>
        (y+x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{k} y^{n-k}
      </md>
      where <m>\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is sometimes written as the special case 
      <md>
        (1+x)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{k}
      </md>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Around 1665 Newton generalized the Binomial Theorem for the case when <m>n</m> is not an integer. When this happens the sum becomes an infinite series.
      <md>
        (1+x)^{\alpha} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{\alpha}{k} x^k
\end{equation*}
      </md>
      where <m>\binom{\alpha}{k} = \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2) \ldots (\alpha-k+1)}{k!}</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Newton never provided a proof of this result!
    </p>

    <p>
      In his 1821 book <it>Cours d'analyse</it> Cauchy gave a proof that the binomial series converges to <m>(1+x)^{\alpha}</m>. Abel was interested in further generalizing the Binomial Theorem to complex exponents and carefully studied Cauchy's proof, which led him to discover a flaw in the proof.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cauchy's proof relies on the fact that <m>\phi(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{\alpha}{k} x^k</m> is a continuous function on <m>(-1,1)</m>, which he claimed followed because the limit of a sum of continuous functions is continuous.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an 1826 paper Abel presented an example that the showed that the limit of a sum of continuous functions is not always continuous and thus Cauchy's proof is incomplete unless the sum converges uniformly. Abel also showed a way to fix Cauchy's proof if this isn't the case.

    <title>Power Series</title>
    

    <p>
      To determine whether the Binomials series is uniformly convergent or not we need to build up some theory involving power series. A power series is a function of the form
      <md>
        f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + \ldots
      </md>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      The binomial series is an example of a power series.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another example is the series
      <md>
        g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n} = x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}+ \ldots
      </md>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Show that <m> \displaystyle g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n} </m> converges when <m>|x| &lt; 1</m>. What happens if <m>x =1</m>? What if <m>x = -1</m>?
    </p>

    <p>
      In the previous example, the set of points where the series converges was the interval <m>[-1,1)</m>. As it turns out the set where a power series converges is always an interval centered at <m>0</m> or the single point <m>\{0\}</m>.In the previous example, the set of points where the series converges was the interval <m>[-1,1)</m>. As it turns out the set where a power series converges is always an interval centered at <m>0</m> or the single point <m>\{0\}</m>.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-interval-of-convergence">
      <statement>
        <p>
          If a power series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n</m> converges at some point <m>x_0 \in \mathbf{R}</m>, then it converges absolutely for any <m>x</m> satisfying <m>|x| &lt; |x_0|</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x_0^n</m> converges. Then the sequence of terms <m>(a_n x_0^n)</m> converges to <m>0</m> and thus is bounded.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence there exists <m>M>0</m> such that <m>|a_n x_0^n| &lt; M</m> for all <m>n \in \mathbf{N}</m>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose <m>|x|&lt; |x_0|</m>. Then,
        <md>
          |a_n x^n| = |a_n x_0^n| \left| \frac{x}{x_0} \right|^n \leq M \left| \frac{x}{x_0} \right|^n.
        </md>
        
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence it follows from the comparison test that 
        <md>
          \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} |a_n x^n| \leq \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} M \left| \frac{x}{x_0} \right|^n.
        </md>
        
      </p>

      <p>
        Since <m>|x| &lt; |x_0|</m> this is a geometric series with <m>r = \left|\frac{x}{x_0} \right| &lt; 1</m> and thus converges. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence <m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} |a_n x^n|</m> converges absolutely.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <p>
      As previously mentioned a consequence of this theorem is that the set of points where a power series converges is either an interval of the form <m>(-R,R)</m>, <m>[-R, R]</m>, <m>(-R,R]</m> or <m>[-R,R)</m> or all <m>\mathbf{R}</m> or <m>\{0\}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This set is referred to as the interval of convergence of the power series and the number <m>R</m> is called the radius of convergence.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the interval of convergence is <m>\mathbf{R}</m> the radius of convergence is said to be <m>\infty</m> and when the interval of convergence is <m>\{0\}</m>, the radius of convergence is said to be <m>0</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-Ratio-Test">
    <title>The Ratio Test</title>

      The Ratio Test is a test for series convergence which is useful for determining the radius of convergence of power series.

      <title>The Ratio Test</title>
      
      
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(a_n)</m> be a sequence of nonzero real numbers.

            <p>

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If there exists <m>k \in \mathbf{N}</m> such that <m>\left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right| \geq 1</m> for <m>n \geq k</m>, then the series <m>\sum a_n</m> is divergent.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        We first prove part 1. Suppose <m>\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| \leq r</m> for <m>n \geq k</m>. Then
        <md>
          <mrow> \amp |a_{k+1}| \leq r |a_k|</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp |a_{k+2}| \leq r|a_{k+1}| \leq r^2 |a_k|</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp \leq r|a_{k+m-1}| \leq r^2 |a_{k+m-2}| \ldots \leq r^m |a_k|</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus
        <md>
          \sum_{n=k}^{\infty} |a_n| \leq \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n |a_k|
        </md>
        and since this is a geometric series with <m>r &lt; 1</m>, <m>\sum a_n</m> converges absolutely by the comparison test.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now we prove part 2. Suppose <m>\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| \geq 1</m> for <m>n \geq k</m>. Then
        <md>
          <mrow> \amp |a_{k+1}| \geq  |a_k| </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp |a_{k+2}| \geq |a_{k+1}| \geq  |a_k| </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp |a_{k+m}| \geq |a_{k+m-1}| \geq  |a_{k+m-2}| \ldots \geq  |a_k|</mrow>
        </md>
        
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus <m> \displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} |a_n| \geq |a_k| &gt; 0</m> and thus the series <m>\sum a_n</m> diverges.
      </p>

    </proof>

    <corollary xml:id="cor-ratio">
      <statement>
        <p>

        </p>
      </statement>

    <p>
      If <m>r=1</m> then the ratio test is inconclusive. The series may converge absolutely, converge conditionally, or diverge.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-Uniform-Convergence-series">
    <title>Uniform Convergence</title>

    <p>
      Let's consider again the problem of proving that the Binomial series converges. Cauchy showed that if the series 
      <md>
        \phi(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{\alpha}{k} x^k
      </md>
      is a continuous function then it must converge to <m>(1+x)^{\alpha}</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We can show that <m>\phi(x)</m> is continuous by showing that the convergence is uniform.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-uniform-convergence">
      <statement>
        <p>
If a power series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n</m> converges absolutely at a point <m>x_0</m>, then it converges uniformly on the closed interval <m>[-c,c]</m> where <m>c = |x_0|</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof>
      <p>
        Recall the Weierstrass M-test states that if <m>|f_n| &lt; M_n</m> and <m>\sum M_n</m> converges then <m>\sum f_n</m> converges uniformly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suppose <m>x \in [-c,c]</m>. Then <m>|a_n x^n| \leq |a_n| |x_0|^n</m> and since <m>\sum a_n x_0^n</m> converges absolutely, it follows from the M-test that <m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n</m> converges uniformly.
      </p>
    </proof>

    <p>
      Show that the Binomial Series <m> \phi(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{\alpha}{k} x^k</m> converges absolutely (and hence uniformly) when <m>|x| &lt; 1</m> and diverges when <m>|x| &lt; 1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It thus follows that <m> \phi(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{\alpha}{k} x^k</m> is continuous on <m>(-1,1)</m> and thus by Cauchy's argument it converges to <m>(1+x)^{\alpha}</m> there.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also know that <m>\phi(x)</m> is undefined when <m>|x|>1</m> because the series diverges. This leaves open the question of what happens at the endpoints <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In particular we want to know if <m>\phi(x)</m> is continuous at these endpoints and thus converges to <m>(1+x)^{\alpha}</m> there as well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Whether the Binomial series converges at the endpoints depends on the value of <m>\alpha</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>\alpha \geq 0</m> then the series converges absolutely at both endpoints. Hence the converges is uniform and <m>\phi(x)</m> is continuous at both endpoints.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>-1 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0 </m> then the series converges conditionally at <m>1</m> and diverges at <m>-1</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>\alpha \leq -1</m> the series diverges. Hence <m>\phi(x)</m> is undefined at the endpoints.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the Binomial series converges conditionally then we can't use the Absolute Convergence Implies Uniform Convergence Theorem to show that the Binomial series converges uniformly at <m>1</m>. Instead we will need to use a theorem due to Abel to show that convergence at a point implies uniform convergence there as well.

      Abel developed this theorem specifically to fix the flaw in Cauchy's proof that the Binomial series converges to <m>(1+x)^{\alpha}</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Because we will want to make use of Abel's Lemma, we first write
        <md>
          g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (a_n R_n) \left( \frac{x}{R} \right)^n

        </md>
        
      </p>

      <p>
        The hypothesis of the theorem is that <m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n R^n</m> converges. Hence by the Cauchy criterion there exists <m>N \in \mathbf{N}</m> such that for <m>n &gt; m \geq N</m>

    <p>
      If <m>-1&lt; \alpha &lt; 0</m> the Binomial series converges conditionally at <m>x=1</m>. Abel's Theorem tells us that it converges uniformly on <m>(-1,1]</m> and thus <m>\phi(x)= \displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \binom{\alpha}{k} x^k</m> is continuous at <m>1</m>.

        Hence it follows that
        <md>
          \lim_{n\to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right| |t| \leq 1
        </md>
        and
        <md>
          \lim_{n\to \infty} \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|  \leq \frac{1}{|t|}
        </md>

      <p>
        Now we apply the ratio test to the series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n a_n x^{n-1}</m>
        <md>
          <mrow> \lim_{n\to \infty} \left| \frac{(n+1)a_{n+1}x^{n+1}}{n a_n x^n}\right| \leq \amp \lim_{n\to \infty} \left| \frac{n+1}{n} \right| \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{ a_n}\right| |x|  </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp \leq \left| \frac{1}{ t}\right| |x|  </mrow>
          <mrow> \amp &lt; 1 </mrow>
        </md>
        
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence it follows from the ratio test that <m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}n a_n x^{n-1}</m> converges absolutely at <m>x</m>.

    </proof>

    <p>
      Combining the previous result with the Term-by-term differentiability Theorem gives us the following conditions for a power series to be differentiable.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-power-series-derivative">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>f(x) = \displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n</m> converges on an interval <m>A \subseteq \mathbf{R}</m>. The function <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>A</m> and differentiable on any open interval <m>(-R,R) \subseteq A</m>. The derivative is given by 
          <md>
            f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a_n x^{n-1}.
          </md>
          
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, <m>f</m> is infinitely differentiable on <m>(-R,R)</m> and the successive derivatives can be obtained via term-by-term differentiation of the appropriate series.
